echo # tweet_generator
## a fun and silly tweet generator that generates sentences that sound ## realistic, but not always sensible.

# We shall attempt the following:

- Use a Python script to randomly generate words from a dictionary.
- Build sentences by sampling these words using a Markov language model.
- Implement grammar rules parsed from the text of a large document set.
- Build data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and heaps to store the words and sentences.
- Analyze the inner workings and performance tradeoffs of each data structure.
- Deploy your language model to a Flask web server on Heroku and connect it to Twitter to let users tweet their favorite results.
